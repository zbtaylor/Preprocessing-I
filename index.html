        <h3>About</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>My path to web development started while studying Graphic Design in college. As part of the curriculum we were taught basic HTML and CSS. Can you believe they were still teaching us to use tables for layout in 2008? I found this new medium enjoyable but didn't pursue it any further at the time.</p>
        <p>After starting my job hunt I realized a lot of companies wanted designers with some HTML and CSS experience so I decided to bring myself in to the future and figure out how to do layout with something other than a table. Eventually I was hired and built a few small websites for my company and realized I enjoyed building them more than designing flyers and brochures.</p>

        <p>My role has morphed significantly during my time here and I continue to wear many hats. Originally hired to build a responsive and cross-browser compatible "skin" for our eLearning lessons, I have since been involved with projects ranging from interactive PDF design to platform support agent.</p>
